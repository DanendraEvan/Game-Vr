# Example of using realistic animated avatars in networked-aframe

The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-valid-avatars) is synced with the [code on glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/naf-valid-avatars) if you want to remix there.

This example is based on [naf-nametag-solidjs](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-nametag-solidjs) for the SolidJS and Tailwind CSS boilerplate
and is using the avatars from the [valid-avatars-glb GitHub repository](https://github.com/c-frame/valid-avatars-glb).

See [how to create an animation](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-valid-avatars/blob/main/docs/animation.md).
